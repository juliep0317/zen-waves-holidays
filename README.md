# About This Project

Zen Waves Holidays is a fictional brand created for educational purposes as part of the Career in Coding course with IT Online Learning.

I aimed to create a relaxing and tranquil feel throughout the newsletter, using calming visuals and soothing content to reflect the peaceful atmosphere of the retreat.

The project is fully responsive and built using HTML and CSS, ensuring the layout adjusts seamlessly for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

The goal was to design and build a fully responsive email newsletter, applying best practices in layout, accessibility, and a mobile-friendly design.
